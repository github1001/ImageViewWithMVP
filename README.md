# ImageViewWithMVP
This is a image view scroller demonstration using Kotlin that aims to follow the MVP/ MVVM model structure towards programming.

I fetch data via https://pastebin.com/raw/wgkJgazE in example for the purpose of this task.

To emulate Android project, I use the Nexus API 23 with 6.5GB ram for the emulator.

The task aims to show data pagination and fecthing data via POST or GET from available public sources where users often stream photos of the web or 
download them for prints.
